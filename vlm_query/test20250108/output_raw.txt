Summarize keypoints to be grasped in all grasping stages.
The length of the list should be equal to the number of stages.
For grasping stage, write the keypoint index. For non-grasping stage, write -1.

"""
Summarize at **the end of which stage** the robot should release the keypoints.
The keypoint indices must appear in an earlier stage as defined in `grasp_keypoints` (i.e., a keypoint can only be released only if it has been grasped previously).
Only release object when it's necessary to complete the task, e.g., drop bouquet in the vase.
The length of the list should be equal to the number of stages.
If a keypoint is to be released at the end of a stage, write the keypoint index at the corresponding location. Otherwise, write -1.
