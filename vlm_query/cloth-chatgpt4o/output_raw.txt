# The task is to fold the cloth step by step. This involves multiple stages of grasping and folding the cloth at different keypoints.
# Since the cloth is a deformable object, we will avoid using path constraints and focus on sub-goal constraints for each stage.
# The stages are as follows:
# 1. Grasp the cloth at keypoint 1.
# 2. Fold the cloth by bringing keypoint 1 to keypoint 3.
# 3. Grasp the cloth at keypoint 2.
# 4. Fold the cloth by bringing keypoint 2 to keypoint 4.
